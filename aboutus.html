<a class="auhistoryheading">Our History</a>
<div class="auhistorybody">
<a class="hostwarebold">hostware™</a> began as a small garage-based startup in 2008 by then 
Yale sophomore Wesley Gustafson. From 2008 - 2014, Gustafson 
polished the antivirus technique and officially launched <a class="hostwarebold">hostware™</a> 
Sept. 1, 2014. Gustafson, who fought a difficult battle with eczema, on 
emphasised the importance of honest business practices and affordability 
until his unfortunate passing in 2018. (He itched too hard.) Since, <a class="hostwarebold">hostware™</a>
has rebranded, rereleasing its new and revolutionary <a class="hostwarebold">hostware™ Shield©</a> in 
March 2021.
